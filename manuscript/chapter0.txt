# FOREWORD

A collection of pure `bash` alternatives to external processes and programs. The `bash` scripting language is more powerful than people realise and most tasks can be accomplished without depending on external programs.

Calling an external process in `bash` is expensive and excessive use will cause a noticeable slowdown. Scripts and programs written using built-in methods (*where applicable*) will be faster, require fewer dependencies and afford a better understanding of the language itself.

The contents of this book provide a reference for solving problems encountered when writing programs and scripts in `bash`. Examples are in function formats showcasing how to incorporate these solutions into code.
